**copyright Anjana Jose (2021)**

Create a function to calculate the distribution of channel type from the top 1000 records in the data set given and load only the top 1000 records of the original 4000 into a separate CSV file or to a database table. 


## Prerequisites
Use Python ( Jupyter Notebook ) for this code.

## Dependencies
- File used for this analysis is 'youtube_dataset.csv'
- Install all required libraries for running the python(using jupyter notebook)
- Load libraries like pandas, numpy and matplotlib.pyplot.

## Usage
#### Import all necessary libraries 
#### Create a new database and import the given data set, ‘youtube_dataset.csv’ in to it.
#### Introduce a function to perform the tasks such as sorting the data with respect to the variable ‘number of subscribers’, form a dataset of 1000 subscribers.
#### Call the function.
#### Plot the distribution. 
#### Save the sorted data in to a csv file.

#### Final Step: Print the data in the saved csv file.
-  we get a new csv file with the data we sort from the given data set.
#### Also, can load the data in to SQL and form a table.





**Note:- Can use this code for different dataset along with various conditions and run it.**

## Dataset used
Dataset used here is uploaded in repository as 'youtube_dataset.csv' - see this [youtube_dataset.csv](youtube_dataset.csv)
